# Overview

For this Project I had the opportunity to learn more about cloudbased databases which was reall interesting. It allowed me to see how I could use what skills I have with relational databases and bring it to a new field. I was able to learn a lot of new things as the syntax is very different, but general understanding remained similar.

I was able to create a database of champions who were all equipped with different titles and wepaons. I was able to manipulate the data to change parts of them, add new champions in, or delete them from the database. I was also able to play around a bit with queries and getting specific information or people from the list.

I wrote this in order to be able to learn more about how cloud based databases function. Also how I can utilize other programming languages in order to work with the data that I have. I was able to gleam a lot about their purpose and how they function, and it will be useful as corporations continue to expand upon cloud based storage.

# Cloud Database

I was utilizing google's cloud based database Fire Store. I also utilized the python tools to build the database.

The database was built with one collection that stored about a dozen champion who each have names, and specific information about them that makes them unique, or match with others. Allowing them to be queried based on said information.

# Development Environment

I utilized firebase and firestore to hold all of the information for the database.

I utilized python to write out the code for this as well as having Visual Studio Code as my IDE.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add more table to the database
* Figure out how to join said tables together for queries 
* Work with sending out reponses to people connected to the database when changes occur.
